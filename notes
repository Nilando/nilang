TODO:
- update parser to accept multi arg calls and funcs
- update the generator to correctly build the IR for func calls
- update the compiler to correctly build the byte code for both calling, 
  and handling input that was passed into the func
- refactor the lexer to be a function

- parsers need a major refactor
  - the code is hard to read and very imperative
  - could be much more declarative
  - look into adding parser combinators
  - consider getting rid of the parser struct and move to a more functional approach

- change lexer from struct to a function
- make bytecode actually readable
- add unit tests
- symbols have been changed to be usize, they need to be changed to u32 to be able to be in a tagged pointer
- display syntax errors
- fix the repl


lexer - pretty much good to go
parser - I feel like it needs a tonn of refactoring? idk
generator - also feels very messy


VERSION 0.1.0
